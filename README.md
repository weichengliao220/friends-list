Hello, my name is Brian Liao.

I just recently graduated from Le Wagon Tokyo, the coding bootcamp, and am currently looking for a new job in the field of web development.

I spent a several days working on this small side-project, which serves as a practice and review for Ruby on Rails framework that was learned and used during the bootcamp.

Thank you!
