# Friends List App

Hello, my name is Brian Liao. Welcome to my GitHub!

I recently graduated from Le Wagon Tokyo's Web Development Coding Bootcamp (Batch #1808) and am currently seeking a junior web developer position.

I spent several days working on this small side-project as a way to practice and reinforce my knowledge of the Ruby on Rails framework, which is learned and used during the bootcamp.

This Friends List App allows users to easily manage their friends and is currently hosted and live on Render: https://friends-list-orxx.onrender.com

For a quick demonstration purpose, you can log in to the app  using the following credentials, which provide access to a list of pre-set example friends:

ðŸ“§Email: user@email.com
ðŸ”‘Password: password

Thank you!
