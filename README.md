Hello, my name is Brian Liao. Welcome to my GitHub!

I just recently graduated from Le Wagon Tokyo - coding bootcamp (batch #1808), and am currently looking for a new job in the field of web development.

I spent several days working on this small side-project, which serves as a practice and review for the Ruby on Rails framework that was learned and used during the bootcamp.

Thank you!
